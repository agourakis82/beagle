## 🔬 Research Risk Mitigation

### Heliobiology (High Risk)
**Risk:** Results are null (no correlation found)  
**Mitigation:**
- Frame as rigorous null result (equally valuable)
- Publish anyway: "No Evidence for Heliobiological Effects..."
- Contribute to debunking pseudoscience (scientific service)

**Risk:** Correlations found but causality unclear  
**Mitigation:**
- Controlled experiments with randomization
- Multiple comparison correction (Bonferroni)
- Pre-registration of hypotheses
- Conservative interpretation

### Physiological Fusion (Medium Risk)
**Risk:** IRB rejection or delays  
**Mitigation:**
- Submit protocol early (Month 3)
- Work with experienced IRB consultant
- Backup: Self-experiment with N=1 (you), then expand

**Risk:** HRV adaptation doesn't improve performance  
**Mitigation:**
- Still publishable: "We tested HRV adaptation; here's what we learned"
- Negative results are valuable (prevent others from wasting time)
- Pivot to other physiological signals (EEG, skin conductance)

### Self-Play (Low Risk - Engineering-Heavy)
**Risk:** Computational cost too high  
**Mitigation:**
- Start small (10 agents), scale gradually
- Use cheaper models for initial tournaments (GPT-3.5, local LLMs)
- Optimize: Only run expensive models (GPT-4) on hard cases

**Risk:** Agents don't improve beyond baseline  
**Mitigation:**
- Still publishable: "We ran largest medical AI tournament; here's what worked/didn't"
- Scientific value in understanding scaling laws
- Contribute open dataset of agent strategies
